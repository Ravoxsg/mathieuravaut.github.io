      Hello! I am <b>1st-year CS PhD student</b> at <a href = https://www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/home.aspx> Nanyang Technological University (NTU)</a>
      in Singapore. I work in <a href = https://ntunlpsg.github.io/><b>NTU-NLP</b></a> lab under the supervision of <a href=https://raihanjoty.github.io/>
      Dr. Shafiq Joty</a>.
      My research is funded by a <a href = https://www.a-star.edu.sg/Scholarships/for-graduate-studies/singapore-international-graduate-award-singa> SINGA scholarship</a>,
      and I am attached to <a href = https://www.a-star.edu.sg/i2r>ASTAR Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R)</a> where I am supervised 
      by <a href = https://sites.google.com/site/nancyfchen/home>Dr. Nancy Chen</a>.</br>
      </br>
      
      Prior to NTU, I worked as a Machine Learning Research Scientist at <a href = https://layer6.ai/>Layer 6 AI</a>, <a href=https://www.td.com/ca/en/about-td/>TD Bank</a>'s 
      AI lab in Toronto. I hold a <a href = https://mscac.utoronto.ca/>Master of Science in Applied Computing (MScAC)</a> from the 
      <a href=https://www.utoronto.ca/>University of Toronto</a> with a <a href = https://mscac.utoronto.ca/concentrations/data-science> concentration in Data Science</a>. 
      Before UofT, I studied Engineering (specialized in applied mathematics) at <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_Centrale_Paris>Ecole Centrale Paris</a>,
      a French Engineering School which is now known as <a href=https://www.centralesupelec.fr/>CentraleSupelec</a> and part of the newly created 
      <a href=https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en>Universite Paris-Saclay</a>. During my Engineering studies I interned at 
      <a href=https://www.thalesgroup.com/en>Thales</a> and <a href=https://www.a-star.edu.sg/i2r>I2R</a>. A long time ago, I studied 
      <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classe_pr%C3%A9paratoire_aux_grandes_%C3%A9coles><i>classe preparatoire</i></a> in mathematics and physics at 
      <a href=https://montaigne-bordeaux.fr/>Lycee Montaigne in Bordeaux</a>.

      Hello! I am **1st-year PhD student** in computer science at [Nanyang Technological University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/home.aspx) 
      in **Singapore**. I work in [**NTU-NLP**](https://ntunlpsg.github.io/) lab under the supervision of [Dr. Shafiq Joty](https://raihanjoty.github.io/). 
      My research is funded by a [SINGA scholarship](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/Scholarships/for-graduate-studies/singapore-international-graduate-award-singa),
      and I am attached to [ASTAR Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R)](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/i2r) where I am supervised by [Dr. Nancy Chen]
      (https://sites.google.com/site/nancyfchen/home). 
      
      Prior to NTU, I worked as a Machine Learning Research Scientist at [Layer 6 AI](https://layer6.ai/), [TD Bank](https://www.td.com/ca/en/about-td/)'s 
      AI lab in Toronto. I hold a [Master of Science in Applied Computing (MScAC)](https://mscac.utoronto.ca/) from the [University of Toronto]
      (https://www.utoronto.ca/) with a [concentration in Data Science](https://mscac.utoronto.ca/concentrations/data-science). 
      Before UofT, I studied Engineering (specialized in applied mathematics) at [Ecole Centrale Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_Centrale_Paris), 
      a French Engineering School which is now known as [CentraleSupelec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/) and part of the newly created [Universite Paris-Saclay]
      (https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en). During my Engineering studies I interned at [Thales](https://www.thalesgroup.com/en) and 
      [I2R](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/i2r). A long time ago, I studied 
      *[classe preparatoire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classe_pr%C3%A9paratoire_aux_grandes_%C3%A9coles)* in mathematics and physics at 
      [Lycee Montaigne in Bordeaux](https://montaigne-bordeaux.fr/).

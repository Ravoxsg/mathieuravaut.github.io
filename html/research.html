        Machine learning for diabetes with administrative health data
      </h3>

      <p align="justify">
        A widespread chronic disease, the incidence of diabetes has been steadily rising in most countries during the last few decades,
        and is expected to continue to increase in the coming years. Diabetes severely affects the quality of life of patients, who become more at-risk for 
        other comorbidities. Complications of diabetes such as kidney failure or amputation can have dramatic consequences, such as 
        putting the patient out of the workforce. 
        Besides, diabetes puts tremendous pressure on public health expenses, costing hundreds of billions of 
        dollars per year. Yet, single-payer health systems across the world, such as in Ontario or in France, have collected admnistrative healthcare
        data on millions of patients with diabetes for decades. Thus we ask ourselves the question: how can machine learning provide insights into diabetes
        based on this administrative health data? 
        In this long project that I started during my end-of-Master degree internship at Layer 6 AI and then continued after joining full-time, we explore
        several use cases of machine learning for diabetes. We first built a model predicting the incidence of diabetes in the future (five years ahead), trained on
        a large and representative sample of Ontario's population. We then built a model trained on patients with diabetes to predict the incidence of a set of
        major diabetes complications in the future (three years ahead).

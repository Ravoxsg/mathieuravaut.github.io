Hello! I am **1st-year PhD student** in computer science at [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/home.aspx) (NTU) in **Singapore**. I wotk in in the [**natural language processing**](https://ntunlpsg.github.io/) (NTU-NLP) lab under the supervision of [Dr. Shafiq Joty](https://raihanjoty.github.io/). My research is funded by a Singapore International Graduate Award scholarship, and I am attached at ASTAR Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R) where I am supervised by Dr. Nancy Chen. 

Prior to that, I worked as a Machine Learning Research Scientist at [Layer 6 AI](https://layer6.ai/), [TD Bank](https://www.td.com/ca/en/about-td/)'s AI lab in Toronto. I hold a [Master of Science in Applied Computing](https://mscac.utoronto.ca/) (MScAC) from the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/). Before that, I studied Engineering (specialized in applied mathematics) at [Ecole Centrale Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_Centrale_Paris), a French Engineering School which is now known as [CentraleSupelec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/) and part of the newly created [Universite Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en). During my Engineering studies I interned at [Thales](https://www.thalesgroup.com/en) and I2R. A long time ago,I studied *[classe preparatoire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classe_pr%C3%A9paratoire_aux_grandes_%C3%A9coles)* in mathematics and physics at [Lycee Montaigne in Bordeaux](https://montaigne-bordeaux.fr/).
